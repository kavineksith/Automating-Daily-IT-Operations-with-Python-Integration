## Python Checksum Manager

### Overview
The Python Checksum Manager script is designed to generate and verify checksums for files using various hashing algorithms such as SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512, and MD5. The script provides flexibility for both generating checksums and verifying existing ones, offering a secure way to ensure file integrity.

### Features
- Generate checksum for a file using specified hashing algorithm.
- Verify checksum against an existing value for file authentication.
- Support for multiple hashing algorithms.
- Error handling for file accessibility and user interruptions.

### Usage
```
python checksum_manager.py <purpose>
```
- `<purpose>`: Specify either 'generate' or 'validate' to perform the respective operation.

### Examples

#### Generating Checksum
To generate a checksum for a file:

```
python checksum_manager.py generate
```
You will be prompted to provide the file path and the desired checksum method. After inputting the required details, the script will compute the checksum and display the result.

#### Verifying Checksum
To verify a file against an existing checksum:

```
python checksum_manager.py validate
```
You will be prompted to provide the file path, checksum method, and the checksum value to verify against. After inputting the required details, the script will compare the computed checksum with the provided value and indicate whether they match or not.

### Conclusion
This comprehensive documentation provides a clear understanding of the Python Checksum Manager script, including usage examples and guidance on accessing the repository for collaborative development. Feel free to customize and enhance the script to suit your specific requirements.
